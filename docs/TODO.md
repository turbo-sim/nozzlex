TODO:
- [ ] Create documentation with Sphinx
- [ ] Implement a generalized function to represent a nozzle geometry for Nakagawa and SMD cases (linear slope for the convergent and divergent sections), and eventually implement a more general one based on splines.
- [ ] Run and validate some cases for the HEM, and eventually establish the routine needed by Menna and Matteo for the many simulations they need.
- [ ] DEM validation for two conditions with Nakagawa with respect experimental data and results digitalized from literature using the old functions.
- [ ] Digitalize the results of Tammone/De Lorenzo on cases 120a and 120b for SMD and plot them in the validation graphs.
- [ ] Do the same for HRM.
- [ ]  Once HRM and DEM are validated, convert them to the new numerical frame using the most recent functions in nozzlex.
