TODO:
1. Implement a generalized function to represent a nozzle geometry for Nakagawa and SMD cases (linear slope for the convergent and divergent sections), and eventually implement a more general one based on splines.
2. Run and validate some cases for the HEM, and eventually establish the routine needed by Menna and Matteo for the many simulations they need.
3. DEM validation for two conditions with Nakagawa with respect experimental data and results digitalized from literature using the old functions.
4. Digitalize vapor quality for the cases 120a and 120b for SMD and plot it the validation graphs.
5. Digitalize the results of Tammone/De Lorenzo on cases 120a and 120b for SMD and plot them in the validation graphs.
6. Do the same for HRM.
7. Once HRM and DEM are validated, convert them to the new numerical frame using the most recent functions in nozzlex.
